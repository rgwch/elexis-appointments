Since you've probably already missed the question: No, there are no cookies here.


But:


To make an appointment with this tool, you must enter your email address and date of birth. Booking is only possible if you are already registered as a patient with us and if we have your email address stored exactly as you enter it here. If this is not yet the case, please provide us with your email address on your next visit.


When you make an appointment, the data entered here will be linked to your existing personal data in our patient database and stored (not visible from outside) as an appointment. We do not share any data; the very fact that you are making an appointment is subject to medical confidentiality.


If you click "Send confirmation" at the end of the appointment booking, an email with the appointment will be sent via the Internet to the specified email address. Please note that such an email is unencrypted and not better protected against unauthorized access than any other email. If you do not want third parties to know that you have made an appointment with us, you should not click this button.

Some options, such as listing and canceling your existing appointments, are protected by a second level: you will receive an email with a link to access when you call them up.

If you do not agree with these conditions, you may not use this tool. In this case, please make your appointment by phone.

Note, if you are not reading this text in German: The translations were done by machine. Please be lenient with errors (but you are welcome to report errors, preferably with a correction suggestion).

Please contact praxis@weirich.ch with all questions and suggestions about this program.
